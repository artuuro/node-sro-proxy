# node-sro-proxy

## Features
- Fully ES6+ JavaScript using BabelJS and NodeJS v14+.
- This is designed to definitely be the easiest way of getting your own edits/custom stuff running.
- Connection is as stable and smooth like there "would be no proxy" when running in production.
- GatewayServer, AgentServer, DownloadServer filters with configuration.
- Unlimited connections (RAM, CPU is your limit).
- Special API designed to allow easily implementing new back-end features or packet handles.
- Session detection (online/offline), updating in database, recording users to rows.
- Web APIs providing full CRUD over entire VSRO database.
- Multiple pre-built controllers to help getting you started creating new content straight away.
- Some fun stuff like modified weather packet (see `src/controllers`).
